## Particle in a Box Simulation

This Python script simulates and visualizes the quantum mechanical behavior of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well (particle in a box). The program generates interactive plots of both the wavefunctions and probability densities for different quantum states.

### Features

- Calculation of wavefunctions for different quantum states (n=1,2,3)
- Visualization of probability densities
- Interactive plots using Plotly
- LaTeX-formatted equations and labels
- Multiple quantum states displayed simultaneously

### Prerequisites

To run this simulation, you'll need the following Python packages:
```python
numpy
plotly
```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone 
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```python
   pip install numpy plotly

   ```
### Usage
Simply run the Python script:
```python
python3 particle_in_a_box.py
```
